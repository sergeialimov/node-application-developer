There are two stream modes:

Binary streams
Object streams

The mode of stream is determined by its objectMode option passed when the stream is instantiated.
The default objectMode is false, which means the default mode is binary.
Binary mode streams only read or write Buffer instances (Buffer were covered in Chapter 11 â€“ Using "Buffers")

In object mode streams can read or write Javascript objects and all primitives (strings, numbers) except null,
so the name is a slight misnomer. In Node core, most if not all object mode streams deal with strings.

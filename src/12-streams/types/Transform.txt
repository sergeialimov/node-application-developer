Class: stream.Transform
Transform streams are Duplex streams where the output is in some way related to the input.
Like all Duplex streams, Transform streams implement both the Readble and Writable interfaces.

Examples of Transform streams:
zlib streams
crypto streams

transform. destroy([error])

Destroy the stream, and optionally emit an 'error' event.
After this call, the transform stream would release any internal resources.
Implementrors should not override this method, but instead implement readable._destroy()
The default implementation of _destroy() for Transform also emit 'close' unless emitClose is set in false

Once destroy() has been called,
any further calls will be no-op and no further errors except from _destroy() may be emitted as 'error'
